vscode-settings
---------------

A repository for settings I use for Visual Studio Code. Place the settings in the following locations:

Linux:
    
    `~/.config/Code/User`
    
    * Note: The `Code` folder may be named differently depending on which fork used (Visual Studio Code or Code OSS, for instance).

macOS:
    
    `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User`

Windows:
    
    `[DRIVE_LETTER]:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Roaming\Code\User`

The settings files can always be found by starting Visual Studio Code, going to `File > Preferences > Settings`, pressing the `Open Settings (JSON)` button in the top-right corner of the editor, and finally opening the Command Palette (default `Ctrl + Shift + P`) and running `File: Open Containing Folder` on Linux, or `File: Reveal in Finder` on macOS.
